Bellow is the assignement wording as it was called by the bootcamp tutors:

"You are required to build a command prompt application.The application must ask from the command prompt to input data to all the entities and it should give the option       
 to add more than one entry at a time. If the user decides not to type any data, the program should use synthetic data.
 Also, your program must be able to output the following:
 •A list of all the students
 •A list of all the trainers
 •A list of all the assignments
 •A list of all the courses
 •All the students per course
 •All the trainers per course
 •All the assignments per course
 •All the assignments per student
 •A list of students that belong to more than one courses
 Lastly, the program should ask from the user a date and it should output a list of students who need to submit one or more assignments on the same calendar week as 
 the given date."
